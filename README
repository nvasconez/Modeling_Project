The following directories listed follow the experiments in the project

General Guidelines
        .data files are the lammps input files
        .txt are quick readable files to test for equilibration and production runs
        Some lammps trajectories were unable to be uploaded due to file size and available on request
        The in.mol_nvt is the lammps job script to run simulations
        The in.submit file is the submission file to the cluster that runs the lammps job and runs PyLAT automatically after the lammps output
        
The bilayer directory leads to the results that change the functional group on each lipid
Octanol-mix coordinates to octanol diffusion with different lipids
Octanol-Temp is diffusion of octanol at different temperatures using the oplsaa model
Octanol-UA is diffusion of octanol at different temperatures using the TraPPE all atom paramters
