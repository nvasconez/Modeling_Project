General Guidelines
        .data files are the lammps input files
        .txt are quick readable files to test for equilibration and production runs
        Some lammps trajectories were unable to be uploaded due to file size and available on request
        The in.mol_nvt is the lammps job script to run simulations
        The in.submit file is the submission file to the cluster that runs the lammps job and runs PyLAT automatically
        after lammps outputs the proper files
        
The following directories listed follow the experiments in the project
        The bilayer directory leads to the results that change the functional group on each lipid
        Octanol-mix coordinates to octanol diffusion with different lipids
        Octanol-Temp is diffusion of octanol at different temperatures using the oplsaa model
        Octanol-UA is diffusion of octanol at different temperatures using the TraPPE all atom paramters
        The files listed in the main folder are for workup in the json reader file and graphing scripts
        for the final project writeup
